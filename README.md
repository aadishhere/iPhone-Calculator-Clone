A simple, yet faithful, clone of the native iPhone Calculator app built using Swift and SwiftUI. This project aims to replicate the look, feel, and basic functionality of the standard iOS calculator.

## Features

* **Authentic Design:** Replicates the visual appearance of the iPhone Calculator interface.
* **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Clear Button:** Functionality to clear the current input.
* **Responsive Layout:** Adapts to different iPhone screen sizes.
* (Add more features as you implement them, e.g., percentage, decimal, sign change, advanced functions like sin/cos/tan, etc.)

## Technologies Used

* **Swift**: The programming language for iOS development.
* **SwiftUI**: Apple's declarative UI framework for building the user interface across Apple platforms.
* **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) for building Apple applications.

## Prerequisites

* A Mac computer running macOS.
* Xcode installed (version 13 or later recommended for SwiftUI).
* An Apple Developer account (not strictly necessary to run on a simulator, but needed for a physical device).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aadishhere/iPhone-Calculator-Clone
    ```

2.  **Open the project in Xcode:**
    Navigate to the cloned directory and double-click the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file (`Calculator.xcodeproj`).

## Running the App

1.  **Select a Simulator or Device:**
    In Xcode, choose an iPhone simulator from the device dropdown menu at the top of the window, or connect a physical iPhone.

2.  **Build and Run:**
    Click the `Run` button (the play icon) in the top-left corner of the Xcode window, or press `Cmd + R`.

3.  The app will build and launch on the selected simulator or device.
